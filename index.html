         <h3 id="history" class="post-title">Ukrainian embroidery with a mystery</h3>
         <p class="post-content">In 2008, the world saw the the first-of-its-kind book about the letter decoding of embroidered symbols on clothing and household items. Volodymyr Pidhirniak, the book’s author, called the book “Text embroidery. Brodivske lettering.” (published in Ukrainian).</p>
         <p class="post-content">Encryption looks like a modern QR code: each symbol hides a letter and a number that together create a unique charm pattern. Thereby, anyone can use such an embroidered alphabet and convey a message via ornaments. </p>
         <p class="post-content">Here’s what the seasons and the names of the months look like:</p>

            <ul class="post-list">
                <li>The word "vyshyvanka" comes from the Ukrainian verb "vyshyvaty", which means "to embroider".</li>
                <li>The earliest known examples of Ukrainian embroidery date back to the 4th century BC.</li>
                <li>Embroidery was originally used as a way to protect the wearer from evil spirits</li>
                <li>The patterns on vyshyvankas often have symbolic meanings. For example, the red thread is often used to
                    represent the blood of Christ, while the black thread represents the earth</li>
                <li>The most common colors used in Ukrainian embroidery are red, black, and white.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="post-content">Vyshyvanka in the collections of world clothing brands</p>
            <p class="post-content">The Ukrainian national dress, the vyshyvanka, has become a popular trend in world
                fashion in recent years.</p>
            <p>Several top clothing brands have included embroidered garments in their collections, inspired by the
                traditional Ukrainian designs.</p>
            <p>One of the first designers to use vyshyvanka motifs was Jean-Paul Gaultier. After visiting Ukraine in
                2005, he was inspired by the Orange Revolution and created a collection of embroidered clothes. The
                models in the show wore outfits named after Ukrainian cities, such as Kyiv, Bukovyna, and Crimea.</p>
            <p class="funParagraph">The Ukrainian national dress is a beautiful and unique tradition, and it
                is exciting to see it being celebrated by designers around the world.</p>
